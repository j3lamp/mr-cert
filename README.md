Mr. Cert
========

A simple node.js-based certificate authority app that would look great on the
bridge of your spaceship next to Mr. Coffee or
[Mr. Radar](https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Radar).

Usage
-----
`node index.js --port <port number> --storage-dir <dtorage directory>`

The storage dir must be writable and will be created if it doesn't exist.

Warning
-------

This is currently pre-alpha, incomplete software. Only the following features
have been implemented at this time:
 - web interface
 - creation of client certificate-key pairs
